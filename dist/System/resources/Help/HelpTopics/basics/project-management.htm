<p><b><a name="creating"><font size="4">Creating a New Project</font></a></b></p>
<p>To create a new database project, you go to the <a href="../menus/file.htm">File Menu</a> and select 'New'. This
will then open the following dialog:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/FileNew.gif"></p>
<h4 align="center">Figure 2: The dialog used to Create a New Project</h4>
<p align="left">Enter the details, as requested, in each of the fields. Those fields which are required are marked with a '*'. </p>
<p align="left">The 'Project Name' is the name as seen by you, in other words,
what do you want to call this project.</p>
<p align="left">If you want this new project to be your default project, then
check the box. This means Compendium will automatically launch this project when
you open the application. If you check the default project box, it will
automatically check the default user box below it. This is because Compendium
needs to login to the default database for you to automatically. Note that you
can check the default user box independently for any project. This will mean
that in the project login window your login details will be automatically filled
in for you. (This does not apply to remote MySQL projects for security reasons).</p>
<p align="left">The 'Author Name' is important to complete as it is the name you wish to be known as when
you export maps and share them with other people. It is this name that is stored
against all nodes and links that you create. The 'Description' field is
optional.</p>
<p align="left">The 'Login Name' and 'Password' fields will be used as the login information, which
you will need to know to access this project later. This user is set as an 'Administrator'
by default.</p>

<p class="Text"><b>N.B.</b> The password entered must be more than 1 character long. If you do not enter  a password  you will be shown an error message. If this happens, just press the 'OK' button on the error message window. You can then enter a password.</p>

<p align="left">Once you have completed all the fields, press the 'Create'
button and a new project will be created and some default data loaded in.&nbsp;
You will then be presented with the project login dialog, (see below).</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Menu</a></p>

<p align="left"><b><a name="open"><font size="4">Opening a Project</font></a></b></p>
<p align="left">Once a project has been create you can access it at any time from the
<a href="../menus/file.htm">File Menu</a> by selecting the 'Open' option. This will open a login window similar to the one below:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/Login.gif" width="396" height="375"></p>
<h4 align="center">Figure 3: The project login dialog window</h4>

<p align="left">If you select a project for which you have specified a default
user, that users login details will automatically be completed for you,
otherwise you will need need to enter the Login Name, and Password yourself and
then press the 'OK' button. The selected project will be opened provided the
login details are valid. The
login is case-sensitive. Note: your current default project will be displayed in
green writing. (For information specifying default projects and default login
details see <a href="../basics/users.htm">User Administration</a> and <a href="#creating">Creating a
New Project</a>).</p>
<p align="left">If you have updated Compendium recently the first time you select a project and try and login  you may see the following message:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/ProjectUpdateMessage.gif" width="533" height="182"></p>
<h4 align="center">Figure 4: The data update message</h4>
<p align="left">At this point you can stop the login process by pressing the
'No' button, or allow the project data structure to be updated by pressing the
'Yes' button. Once the structure has been updated, the login process will be
completed and the project opened. </p>

<p align="left">
<a name="convert"><b><font size="4">Converting a MySQL Project</font></b></a></p>

<p align="left">If you already had Compendium 1.3x installed, you will have
MySQL database projects that you may wish to import into Compendium 1.4. These database
projects
will need converting from  MySQL to Derby (the new Compendium default database). </p>

<p align="left">You can only do this when you are connected to the Derby
database.&nbsp; (See <a href="database-maintenence.htm">Database Maintenance</a>).</p>

<p align="left">From the File Menu select 'Convert From MySQL To Derby..'. If
you only have one MySQL profile setup it will automatically show you the
projects list in the dialog, as in figure 5a:</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Figure 5a: The Convert MySQL Project window
with one profile setup.</font></p>

<p align="left">If you have more than one MySQL profile setup the dialog will
present you with a drop-down menu from which to select a profile and then it
will load the list, (see figure 5b below for an example).</p>

<p align="left">Select the MySQL project you wish to convert and press the
'Convert' button.&nbsp; A small dialog will appear asking you to enter the name
you wish to call the converted project. The current name will be filled in for
you, but you can change it. Press OK to continue.</p>

<a name="derby"><b><font size="4">Converting a Derby Project</font></b></a></p>

<p align="left">If you wish to convert the Compendium default projects (in
Derby), to a MySQL database project, you must first connect to the MySQL
database into&nbsp; which you wish
to convert the projects,&nbsp; (See <a href="database-maintenence.htm">Database Maintenance</a>).</p>

<p align="left">From the File Menu select 'Convert Project..', then 'From Derby
To MySQL'. This will
open a dialog listing the Derby database projects available, similar to figure
8:</p>

<p align="left">Select the Derby project you wish to convert and press the
'Convert' button.&nbsp; A small dialog will appear asking you to enter the name
you wish to call the converted project (see figure 6 above). The current name will be filled in for
you, but you can change it. Press OK to continue. A progress bar will inform you of how the conversion is going.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left"><b><a name="edit"><font size="4">Editing a  Project Name</font></a></b></p>

<p align="left">To edit the name of a project, first open the Project
Management dialog (see <a href="#overview">Overview</a>) and then select the
project from the list then press the 'Edit Name' button. You will be asked to
login (see figure 9) and then you will be presented with a dialog like the one

if you change your mind. You will be presented with a progress bar informing you
of how the copy is proceeding.</p>

<p align="left">Once the copy is complete, you will see it appear in the list in
the 'Project Management' window.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="#top">Back to Menu</a></p>


<p align="left"><b><a name="backup"><font size="4">Backing a Project Up</font></a></b></p>


<p align="left">To backup a project, you have two options. One options is to open the
Project
Management dialog (see <a href="#overview">Overview</a>) and then select the
project from the list then press the 'Backup' button. You will be asked to login
(see figure 10).&nbsp; If you already have a project open, you can select
'Backup' from the <a href="../menus/file.htm">File Menu</a>. Note: this option
will only be available if you are an administrator.</p>


<p align="left">Which ever way you chose to initiate a backup you will then be
shown the following dialog:</p>


<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/BackupDialog.gif" width="409" height="261"></p>


<p align="center"><font size="2">Figure 13: Backup dialog.</font></p>


<p align="left">On this dialog you can select to Backup to either an sql file,
which will backup just the project contents, or a zip file with references. </p>


<p align="left">The
  zip file will contain the sql file with the project data, as well as copies of
  the externally references local files.<br>
  If you choose to Backup to Zip then two further options will become available. These two options control how the Referenced files are stored inside the Zip file. By default the first option is selected. This options, 'Zip all Reference files into Linked File' means that inside the zip file the reference files will be put into a Linked Files folder structure (Linked Files/&lt;projectname&gt;/&lt;usename_useid&gt;/referencefile). This is useful if you will be  unzipping the backup on another machine. All the file paths in the backuped up sql data will be adjusted to match this folder structure. You can however check the option labelled
  'Leave Reference file paths untouched', which will place the reference file in the zip
  with the same paths as they have on your computer. This is useful if you are backing up for your restoring on your own machine where you want the paths to remain the same. </p>
<p align="left">Which ever options you select from this dialog
you will then see a window similar to the following where you will be asked to
enter the name of the backup file. This will wither request an .sql file or a
.zip depending on the option you have previously chosen.</p>

select to restore over an existing project, all the data in that project will be
deleted and replaced with the data from the backup file. So use this option with
caution!</p>


<p align="left">To restore a project from a backup, first open the Project
Management dialog (see <a href="#overview">Overview</a>) and then select the
project from the list that you wish to restore over, and press the 'Restore To' button. You will be asked to login
