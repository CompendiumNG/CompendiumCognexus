<h1>Templates</h1>

<hr width="100%" color="black"></hr>
</center>
<p>In Compendium a template is basically a Compendium xml export file, which 
holds a set of maps/nodes which you wish to use over and over again. For 
example, you might create a template map for a type of meeting discussion with 
certain question nodes that always come up in each meeting. Then at the start of 
a discussion of that type, you would create a new Map and populate it from your 
meeting template.</p>
<p>What makes a Compendium xml export file a template rather than a backup or a 
way or sharing data is simply the way that the file is imported. If 
you import a Compendium xml file and do NOT select 'Preserve Transclusions' or 
'Preserve Imported Node IDs', then Compendium creates new nodes with new node 
ids rather than transclusions to existing nodes.</p>
<p>You can,&nbsp; of course do this your self through the standard <a href="../ImportExport/import_xml.htm">Import From XML</a> 
option. But Compendium has some built-in support to make things easier.</p>
<p>In the Compendium application home directory, there is a subfolder called 
'Templates', which is initially empty. This is suggested as the best place to 
store the xml exports that you wish to use as templates. </p>
<p>There are currently two ways in which Compendium provides additional support 
for using templates, and these are discussed below.</p>
<p><b>Template Menu</b></p>
<p>On the <a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tools Menu</a> there is a submenu called 
'Templates'. This menu will list all files and folder found in the Templates 
folder which is in your Compendium application folder. </p>
<p>It will create submenus as required by the folder structure you create in 
your Templates folder. For each folder it will create a submenu and for each xml 
file it will create a menu item. When you select a menu item, that xml file will 
be automatically imported into the current view as a template (with new nodes 
and node ids).</p>
<p><b>Stencils</b></p>
<p>As part of the Stencils system, you can associate a Compendium xml file with 
a Stencil item, provided it is a map or list type. When that stencil item is dragged 
from the stencil palette onto a view, the map or list node is created and is populated 
automatically with the contents of the associated Compendium xml file. See 
<a href="stencilsets.htm">Stencils</a> section for more details.</p>
