The memetic project supports the development of asynchronous collaboration on
the Access Grid. The Access Grid™ (AG) is an open collaboration and resource
management architecture ( for more information on the Access Grid see:
<a href="http://www.accessgrid.org">http://www.accessgrid.org</a> ). Compendium 
is one of many tools which can be used in conjunction with Access Grid meetings. <p>

<p>Compendium can be setup and controlled in an Access Grid meeting in two ways: 
<ul type="i">
  <li><b>Using the memetic Meeting Manager:<i> </i></b>You can run a memetic-enabled 
  meeting using specific web pages, known as the 'memetic Meeting Manager', which can be accessed from the memetic website 
  (see below). The Meeting Manager will control and co-ordinate the whole process of setting up a memetic-enabled meeting and 
  starting/stopping all the various softwares for you, (the recommended route to take).</li>
  <li><b>Using Compendium Directly:</b>&nbsp; For the more experienced user, you can setup and control the various softwares including Compendium, yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on the memetic project, and access to the webpages for 
running a memetic-enabled Access Grid meeting, please go to:
http://www.memetic-vre.net/&nbsp;&nbsp; (you will 
need to copy this link to your browser).</p>
</p>
<p>Whichever route you take, there are four basic memetic areas to be aware of 
in Compendium. For each of these areas the help texts below will mainly describe 
the process for using Compendium directly (option ii, above), as there will be separate help pages 
for the memetic Meeting Manager on the website. Look out for areas labelled as '<b>For 
All</b>' as those notes apply whether you are using Compendium directly or 
through the Meeting Manager.</p>
<p>The four main memetic related areas in Compendium can be accessed directly from the <a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tool Menu</a>,
using the memetic submenu. There is also a <a href="../toolbars/meeting.htm">Meeting Toolbar</a>, which is part of the
memetic specific functionality in Compendium. </p>
<p>If you are using the web-based control system to 
run your memetic-enabled Access Grid meeting you will not have to specifically 
access these menu items or the toolbar.</p>
<p>The four areas are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#setup">Access Grid Meeting Setup</a></li>
  <li><a href="#record">Record An Access Grid Meeting</a></li>
  <li><a href="#replay">Replay An Access Grid Meeting</a></li>
  <li><a href="#upload">Upload Recorded Meeting Events</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b><a name="setup"><font size="4">Access Grid Meeting Setup</font></a></b></p>
<p>Before you can use Compendium in an Access Grid meeting it requires certain 
data to connect to Access Grid related features. </p>
<p><b>Using the memetic Meeting Manager:</b> The data will be passed into Compendium from the 
webpage and setup for you.</p>
<p><b>Using Compendium Directly:</b> </p>
<p>Only the proxy data is optional, if you are not using a proxy. All other data
must be completed or you will be shown an error message when trying to record a 
meeting.&nbsp; Figure 1 below show the setup dialog and the table below that 
describes each of the fields. Complete the fields and press 'Save' the store the 
data.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="record"><b><font size="4">Record An Access Grid Meeting</font></b></a></p>
<p align="left">Before you can record a meeting, Compendium needs to download 
the meeting data and create the initial meeting map. </p>
<p><b>Using the memetic Meeting Manager:</b> Loading the meeting 
data will be controlled for you from the Meeting Manager. Then, when 
ready,&nbsp; starting and stopping the recording of the meeting will be done 
from Meeting Manager too (See the help for Meeting Manager on the memetic website, for more details).</p>
<p><b>Using Compendium Directly:</b>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Before you can start recording the events for an Access Grid
meeting in Compendium, you must have obtained the initial meeting data from
the triplestore database (the url entered above in the setup dialog). The first thing
you will need is the URI for the meeting in question. This can be obtained from the
appropriate webpage (see the memetic website for more details)</p>
<p align="left">Once you have this URI, enter it into the first field in the
Meeting Recorder dialog, as seen below. This dialog can be access either from
the <a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tool Menu</a>,
using the memetic submenu (or by pressing the first button on the <a href="../toolbars/meeting.htm">Meeting Toolbar</a>,
if the current map is a meeting map which has not been recorded previously).
Press 'Load Meeting Data'. If you have downloaded the meeting before, and it has
not been recorded yet, you will be asked if you would like to update the data
held on that meeting map. </p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/MeetingRecorderDialog.gif" width="388" height="406"></p>
<p align="center">
<font size="2">Figure 2. The Meeting Recorder dialog.</font></p>
<p align="left">Otherwise, Compendium will then download all known meeting data
such as attendees and agenda items from the Access Grid triplestore. This data
will be displayed to you in a popup window similar to the one below:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/MeetingMapDialog.gif" width="468" height="491"></p>
<p align="center">
<font size="2">Figure 3. The Meeting Map dialog.</font></p>
<p align="left">If you are happy that you have the correct meeting, press the
'Create Meeting Map' button. A new map node with relevant contents will then be
created and added to the current view. Below is an example of the above 
meeting's auto-generated Compendium meeting map. This map can be created before the meeting if
you wish to add additional nodes.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/MeetingMap.gif" width="531" height="590"></p>
<p align="center">
<font size="2">Figure 4. The Meeting Map auto-generated from the data in figure 
3 above.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b>For All:<i> </i></b>If you add additional agenda items to a meeting map yourself 
can you please tag them as an 'Agenda Item' in order for them to be processed 
correctly later by the Meeting Replay tool. </p>
<p align="left">When you are ready to record a meeting, you can either open the 
Meeting Recorder dialog dialog and select the meeting to record and press 'Start', 
or you can open the meeting map and press the 'start' icon on
the <a href="../toolbars/meeting.htm">Meeting Toolbar</a>.  </p>
<p align="left">Compendium will
firstly re-download the meeting data to see if it has changed at all, and update
the meeting map contents appropriately (for example, if new agenda items have
been added). Compendium will also need to retrieve the Arena clock time. If all
this goes well, you will then see a small dialog telling you that recording has
now started, otherwise you will see an appropriate error message.</p>
<p align="left"><b> Using memetic Meeting Manager:<i> </i></b>To stop recording, press the 
stop button in the Meeting Manager recorder page. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Using Compendium Directly:<i>&nbsp; </i></b>To stop recording, press the 'stop' icon on the <a href="../toolbars/meeting.htm">Meeting Toolbar</a>, 
or press the 'Stop' button on the Meeting Recorder dialog. </p>
<p align="left"><b>For All:</b>
Once you have stopped recording you will see a dialog asking you if you wish to 
upload the Compendium meeting event data now,  or discard the data, (see dialog below):</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/MeetingEventUploadOptionsDialog.gif" width="336" height="141"></p>
<p align="center">
<font size="2">Figure 5. The Upload Choice dialog.</font></p>
<p align="left">If you select 'Upload Now', all the event data captured by 
Compendium will be converted to n3 format and uploaded to the triplestore. The 
relevant compendium views will be exported to XML along with any referenced 
materials and put in a zip file. This file will be uploaded. If anything goes 
wrong during the upload of either file, the files are stored locally and you can 
attempt a further upload lin the future (for details on how to upload this data 
later see <a href="#upload">Upload Recorded Meeting Events</a>). &nbsp; If you 
select 'Discard', Compendium will delete all the event data stored for that 
meeting.</p>
<br>
<p align="left"><a name="replay"><b><font size="4">Replay An Access Grid Meeting</font></b></a></p>
<p align="left">To replay an Access Grid Meeting you must first have recorded a 
meeting, (see <a href="#record">Record An Access Grid Meeting</a> for more 
details). </p>
<p align="left"><b> Using memetic Meeting Manager:<i> </i></b>The setup, 
starting and stopping of a meeting replay will all be done for you from Meeting 
Manager replay section. (See the help for Meeting Manager on the memetic website, for more details).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Using Compendium Directly:<i> </i></b> </p>
<p align="left">Open the Meeting Replay dialog to see a list of all meetings 
that have been recorded. This dialog can be access either from the <a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tools Menu</a>,

<p>Select a Meeting and enter the Jabber details, then press 'Connect'. 
Compendium will try to establish a Jabber connection to the conference you 
requested in the Conference JID. </p>
<p>You should see a small message dialog telling you when it has connected. 
Compendium can now communicate with the Meeting Replay software and it with 
Compendium. You should see that all the nodes have gained a small red 'M' 
indicator icon.&nbsp; You can click this icon if you wish to make Meeting Replay 
jump to the time point in the meeting video recording that the node was created. 
You can also do this by selecting 'Replay Video' from the Node right-click menu.</p>
<p><b>For All:</b> Currently you can change the Video Index for a 
Compendium node after it has been created, either through the Properties page of 
the node Contents dialog, or by using the node right-click menu and selecting 
'Assign the Video' which assigns the Video Index of that node to any other 
select nodes. This change is only local to Compendium and is not currently 
uploaded as event data to the triplestore. </p>
<p>Assign the Video Index of this node to the other select nodes</p>
<p>During the time you are connected, Compendium will be recording node 
creation/deletion and tag creation/deletion events which you can choose to 
upload the the triplestore when you stop replaying.</p>
<p align="left"><b> Using memetic Meeting Manager:<i> </i></b>To stop replaying, press the
