<h1>Scribble Pad</h1>

The scribble pad is an invisible layer that you can turn on and off and onto 
which you can scribble, using specific drawing tools on the scribble pad toolbar 
(see figure 1).
<p>By default the scribble pad layer sits
over a map's node and link layers. Therefore whilst it is the front layer you cannot
access nodes and links or their right-click menus etc.. You can however, move 
the scribble pad layer behind the node and link layers with the second toolbar 
button, or you can de-activate
(hide) the scribble pad at any point with the first toolbar icon.&nbsp; Both 
these options will hand over your keyboard and mouse actions back to the map, so 
you can perform standard mapping functions.</p>
<p>Deactivating the toolbar hides the layer so you can see your nodes and links 
with out the scribbles. The
scribble data will be kept for that session, so you can then activate (show) the
scribble pad again to view your scribbles once more. If you close the map without saving
the scribble pad contents, it will be lost.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b>
This facility is only for use with map views and will not work for list views.
Also, currently, if you scale the view, only the node and link layers are scaled, not the
scribble layer.</p>
<p>You can activate the scribble layer for the current map either from the <a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tools Menu</a>, or the
<a href="../toolbars/scribble.htm">Scribble Pad Toolbar</a>.</p>

The rest of the toolbar has options for drawing (scribbling). There are
currently four drawing tools available:</p>

&nbsp;<p>You can set the line colour for drawing by pushing the coloured square
button which opens the Colour chooser dialog
            to let you select a colour:</p>

<h4 align="center">Figure 2. The colour Chooser dialog.</h4>

<p align="left">You can set the line thickness using the drop down box which
currently holds options from 1 to 10 pixels, the default being 1.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a map with some scribbles on it:</p>

<h4 align="center">Figure 4. An example of some scribbles.</h4>

</center>
<p>This is example is fairly meaningless, but you can image a situation where
this would be useful to highlight areas or emphasise certain aspects of a map.&nbsp;
These scribbles are not objects which can be moved or resized (not yet anyway),
they are merely pixel painting over the map. For a given session of using the
scribble pad, you can undo all the drawing done that session, in stages (each
shape, or line, or piece of scribbling) with the
undo/redo buttons on the <a href="../menus/edit.htm">Edit Menu</a> or the <a href="../toolbars/main.htm">Main Toolbar</a>. </p>
<p>If you show / hide (activate/deactivate) the scribble pad layer on a given
map it will hold the information
temporarily until you close the map completely. If you choose to save the scribble pad
contents to the database, then the scribbles will be re-drawn every time you
open a map and turn on the scribble pad layer. </p>
<p><b>REMEMBER:</b> Each time you make changes to the scribble layer save them,
if you want to keep them permanently.</p>
