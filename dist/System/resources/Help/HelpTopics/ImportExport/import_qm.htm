<h1>Import from Questmap</h1>

<hr width="100%" color="black"></hr>
</center>

<h2>Import Options</h2>

<p>There are two options for importing from Questmap:  (see the <a href="overview.htm">Overview</a>, for help on how to access these options)<br><br>
<b>1.</b> Current View: This allows you to import a questmap file into the currently active view.  Below is an example of the dialog you will see when you select this option.</p>

<br>

</center>
<br>

<p>There are three main import options:</p>

<br>
<center>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">

	<thead>
  		<tr class="header">
   			<td width="200" valign="top">
   				<p><b>Option</b></p>
   			</td>
   			<td width="300" valign="top">
   				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
   			</td>
  		</tr>
 	</thead>

 	<tr>
  		<td width="200" valign="top">
  			<p>Import Questmap author and date imformation</p>
  		</td>
  		<td width="300" valign="top">
  			<p>If this option is selected, all author and date information of nodes and links will be imported from the Questmap file. </p>
  		</td>
 	</tr>
 	 <tr>
  		<td width="200" valign="top">
  			<p>Set author as "Current Author" and all dates as today</p>
  		</td>
  		<td width="300" valign="top">
  			<p>If you wish all nodes to be imported with todays date, and with the current user as the author, select this option. <br><br>You can further qualify this option, by selecting to store the original author and date information in the detail of the node.</p>
  		</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  		<td width="200" valign="top">
  			<p>Import as transcluded nodes</p>
  		</td>
  		<td width="300" valign="top">
  			<p>If this option is selected it means that if your database already contains any of the imported Questmap nodes, it will bring the nodes in as transclusion to that original node.<br><br> If you wish all nodes to be imported as new nodes, check this option, before proceeding.</p>
  		</td>
 	</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br>

<p><b>2.</b> Multiple Views: This allows you to select one or more views to import a Questmap file into.  Below is an example of the dialog you will see when you select this option:</p>

<br>
<center>
<IMG SRC="../images/ImportQMMultiple.gif">
<h4>Figure 2. The Questmap Import dialog for multiple views</h4>
</center>
<br>

<p>This dialog has the same import properties as that in option 1 above, except that it has a list of views at the top of the window, so you can select which views you wish to import into. </p>

<br>
<h2>Importing</h2>

<p>Once you have completed the import options, press the 'Import...' button. A file browser dialog window will open, (see figure 3 below),  and you will need to locate the file that you wish to import.</p>
