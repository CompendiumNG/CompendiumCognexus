<p><b>Adding and Removing Tags from Groups</b></p>
<p>To assign some tags to a group, you must first select the group you wish to work with. You do this using the drop-down list at the top of the screen labelled 'Existing Groups'.</p>
<p>Once you have selected a group you will see the lists change. Figure 2 shows an example of a chosen group.</p>

<p>The left-hand list will display all existing tags which have <b>not</b> been assigned to this group. The right-hand list will show all tags which have been assigned to this group. In figure 1, you can see that a tag group called <i>Michelle5</i> has one tag assigned called <i>akt-tm-war-story</i>.</p>
<p>To add and remove tags to and from a group you use the 'Add' and 'Remove' buttons. In order to save your changes you must press either the 'Apply' or 'OK' buttons, which appear at the bottom of the dialog. The 'Apply' button will save your changes but leave the dialog window open. The 'OK' button will save your changes and then close the dialog window.</p>

<p><b>The Active Group</b></p>
<p>At any given time, only one tag group is considered to be 'active'. The active group is the one used to fill the Tag drop-down list, which appears on the main toolbar (see <a href="../toolbars/main.htm">The Main Toolbar</a>). This provides a shortcut for quick tag allocation while dialog mapping. In order to set which group should be the active group, you must first select it from the 'Existing Groups' drop-down list, and then press the 'Set As Active Group' button. The currently active group will appear in 
green lettering both here and on the Tag Assignment panel (see <a href="tag_assignment.htm">Tag Assignment</a>).</p>
<p><b>N.B.</b> If no group has been set as active then all tags will be displayed in the 'quick allocation' tag list on the main toolbar.</p>
