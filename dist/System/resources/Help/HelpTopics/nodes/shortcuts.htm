<p>A 'shortcut' node is a copy of a node which keeps a reference to the node that it was copied from.</p>
<p> It's main use is with large maps which may require more than one instance of a node to appear at various positions for clarity or extension. You cannot have more than one instance of the same node (a transclusion) in the same map (or list), therefore, shortcuts allow you to mimic this facility. </p>

<p>To create a shortcut to a node, first select the node you want to shortcut, open its right-click menu and then select the 'Shortcut' menu item, (see figure 1).</p>

<p>A new shortcut node will appear to the south-east of the original node, (see figure 2 below). Shortcut nodes can be distinguished by the red-arrow in the node icon's bottom left-hand corner.</p>

<p><b>N.B.</b> Shortcuts to views, (as in the example in figure 2., showing a shortcut to a map), are not real views. They do not contain other nodes or links. They 
merely remember the node  they where created from. Also, although the name may suggest it, clicking on a shortcut <b>does not</b> take you to the original node.</p>
