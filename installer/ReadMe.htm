      <p class="ciparagraph">Compendium is a
          hypertext concept mapping tool which can be used as an individual or
      group tool to model problems, and capture discussions.<br>
        <br>
        This tool supports the Compendium methodology for Dialogue Mapping
        and collaborative visual modelling, as described on the Compendium
      Institute website.<br>
      </p>

      <p class="ciparagraph"><a href="#top" class="content">Back to top</a></p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">&nbsp;</p>      <p class="ciparagraph"><span class="ciheader3"><a name="install"></a>II. Install Compendium</span> </p>
      <p class="ciheader4"><a name="windows"></a>Windows</p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">Compendium is a Java application, so it requires
        a Java Runtime Environment (v1.5+) to be installed.</p>      <p class="ciparagraph">If you have a previous version of installed you can install this version
        directly over your existing installation. The default location is: C:\Program
        Files\Compendium. Your original properties files will not be affected.</p>

      <p class="ciheader4"><a name="mac"></a>Mac OS X</p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">There are two releases of Compendium for Mac OS X: <br>
      	10.3 and 10.4.<br>
      	The release for 10.3 (Panther) requires Java JRE v1.4.1_02 or later to be installed.<br>
      	The release for 10.4 (Tiger) requires Java J2SE 5.0 Release 4 (aka 1.5.0_04) or later.</p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">If
          you are unsure which version of Java you have installed, open a terminal
      window (inside Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and type: java -version</p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">The output from running that command will look something like:</p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">java version "1.5.0_07"<BR>
        Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition   (build 1.5.0_07-164)<BR>
        Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_07-87, mixed   mode, sharing)</p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">So the above shows that Java 1.5.0_07 is installed in this example which is fine as it is greater than the required 1.5.0_04 </p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">Once you have downloaded the relevant .dmg file from the compendiuminstitute.org
        website you need to double click the .dmg file to mount the disk image.
        This will open a window showing you the compendium .pkg file. Double
        click the package file and this will run the installer. Follow the installer
        instructions.</p>

       <p class="ciparagraph">NOTE: Currently, due to unresolved file permission issues,
       only the user installing Compendium will be able to run it, unless Compendium subfolders
       have thier permissions changed appropriately.</p>

      <p class="ciparagraph"><span class="ciparagraphbold">TECH TIP:</span> You
        might like to be aware that Compendium sets the Memory allocation for
        the JRE up to 256mb (the default is 64mb). If you need to change this
        value for any reason, you will need to open the contents of the Compendium
        Application file using the 'Show Package Contents' option on the right-click
        menu, then open the Contents' folder and edit the VMOptions property
        in the info.plist file. Please only attempt this if you are a confident
        user.</p>

<p class="ciparagraph">
<span class="ciparagraphbold">TECH TIP:</span> In order to automatically open external files and links on the Mac,
Compendium stores file extension and application associations in a file in
&lt;Compendium home folder&gt;/System/resources called LaunchApplications.properties.
This file is added to as the user tries to launch various file types for the
first time and picks an application to use. We have preloaded this file with
three type, 'www', 'http' and 'https', and we have associated them with the path
'/Applications/Safari'. If you do not have this application or have it in
another location, you will need to edit this file appropriately.</p>

      <p class="ciparagraph">Compendium is a Java application, so it requires a Java Runtime Environment
        (v1.5) to be installed before you can run it.</p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">Once you have downloaded the relevant .tar file from the compendiuminstitute.org
        website, simply unpack it. </p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">You can run Compendium by navigating to the Compendium
        directory and typing: <span class="ciparagraphbold">./compendium.sh</span></p>

      <p class="ciparagraph">When you import a map from QuestMap with Pros and Cons, they come out
        as Arguments in Compendium (even though they are linked to other nodes). </p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">Exporting to an XML file in an off-line directory can cause the file
        to be corrupted. (This is a known Windows problem). </p>
      <p class="ciparagraph"><span class="ciheader4"><a name="issuewindows"></a>Windows</span> &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">There is a general bug with Java running on machines with some versions
        of NVidia video drivers. If you have a graphics card which uses these
        drivers, and experience problems running Compendium, you should make
        sure that you have the latest drivers installed. </p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">There is a problem with some Tablet PCs and graphics drivers. A workaround
        is to switch off Java 2D graphics. This can be done by editing the compendium.bat
        file. The final line in the batch file should resemble: </p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">start&nbsp;/b&nbsp;javaw&nbsp;-<span class="ciparagraphbold">Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true</span>&nbsp;-Xmx256m&nbsp;<br>-classpath&nbsp;etc..&nbsp;etc..</p>
      <p class="ciheader4"><a name="issuemac"></a>Mac OS X </p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">There can be problems with permissions and Compendium accessing/creating
        subfolders when the Mac user installing and using Compendium is not part
        of the Admin group. </p>
      <p class="ciheader4"><a name="issuelinux"></a>Linux </p>
      <p class="ciparagraph">Drag and dropping files, images, text etc. from external applications
        into Compendium cannot currently beimplemented for the Linux platform
        release of Compendium.</p>
