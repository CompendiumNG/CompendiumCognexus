<p><b>All Platforms</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>Help system search results list has random paint errors, when using JRE 1.4.1_02, and the highlighted words are very dark (N.B. click on them to see in white text)</li>
 <li>When you import a map from QuestMap with Pros and Cons, they come out as Arguments in Compendium (even though they are linked to other nodes).</li>
</ul>

<b>On Windows</b>
<ul>
 <li>There is a problem with some Tablet PCs and graphics drivers. A workaround
 is to switch off Java 2D graphics. This can be done by editing the compendium.bat file.
 The final line in the batch file should resemble:
<br><br>start /b C:\&quot;Program Files&quot;\Java\j2re1.4.1_02\bin\javaw <b>-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true</b> -Xmx128m -classpath
 &quot;.;compendiumcore.jar;compendium.jar;skinlf.jar;xml.jar;kunststoff.jar;jabberbeans.jar;jsearch.jar;jhall.jar;mysql-connector-java-3.1.0-alpha-bin.jar&quot;

 <br><br></li>
  <li>There is a problem with some Tablet PCs and linking nodes with the right
  mouse click. <span class="ciparagraph">One workaround is to press
  Control-Shift while right-clicking to create a link.</span></li>
 <li>There is a general bug with Java running on machines with some versions of NVidia
 video drivers. If you have a graphics card which uses these drivers, and
 experience problems running Compendium, you should make sure that you have the
 latest drivers installed.</li>
 <li>Exporting to an XML file in an off-line directory can cause the file to be corrupted. (This is a known Windows problem).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>On Mac OS X</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>There can be problems with permissions and Compendium accessing/creating
  subfolders when the Mac user is not part of the Admin group.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>On Linux</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Drag and dropping files, images, text etc. from external applications into
  Compendium cannot currently be implemented for the Linux platform release of
  Compendium.</li>
</ul>
