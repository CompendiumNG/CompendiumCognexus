<p>Initially Compendium will have no projects set up.  </p>

<p class="TableText">So the first time you open Compendium you will be presented 
with the 'New Project' dialog asking you to enter the details to create your 
first Compendium project:</p>

<center>
<h4><img border="0" src="../images/CompendiumNew.gif" width="626" height="548"></h4>
<h4>Figure 1: The Compendium Application when first opened</h4>
</center>
Enter the details, as requested, in each of the fields. The compulsory fields haev an '*' beside them.

<p align="left">The 'Project Name' is the name as seen by you, in other words,
what do you want to call this project.</p>
<p align="left">If you want this new project to be your default project, then 
check the box. This means Compendium will automatically launch this project when 
you open the application. If you check the default project box, it will 
automatically check the default user box below it. This is because Compendium 
needs to login to the default database for you to automatically. Note that you 
can check the default user box independently for any project. This will mean 
that in the project login window your login details will be automatically filled 
in for you. (This does not apply to remote MySQL projects for security reasons).</p>
<p align="left">The 'Author Name' is important to complete as it is what you wish to be known as when
you export maps and share them with other people. It is this name that is stored
against all nodes and links that you create. </p>
<p align="left">The 'Login Name' and 'Password' fields will be used as the login information, which
you will need to know to access this project later. This user is set as an 'Administrator' 
by default.</p>
<p align="left">Once you have completed all the fields, press the 'Create'
button and a new project will be created and some default data loaded in. </p>
<p align="left">Once the project has been create you will be presented with a login window, similar 
to the one below, (though initially only showing your one new project):</p>
<p align="center">

<h4 align="center">Figure 2: The project login dialog window</h4>
<p align="left">For details on the coloured balls and other elements shown in figure 2, see 
<a href="../basics/project-management.htm#open">Opening a Project</a>, and for project related issues in general see 
<a href="../basics/project-management.htm">Project Management.</a>

<p>If you did not check the box to make the user of your new 
project the default user, you now need to enter the Login Name, and Password as 
you entered them in figure 1. The login is case-sensitive. Otherwise they will 
be automatically completed for you. Once you have pressed 
the 'OK' button the project will be opened and you will see a screen similar to 
the one below:</p>
