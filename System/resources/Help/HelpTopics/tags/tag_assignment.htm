<p>Below, in figure 1, you can see an example of a Tag Assignment panel for a node called 'Michelle.</p>
<p>The left-hand section displays a list of all currently exisiting tag groups and tags. For example, there is a tag groups called <i>Fred1</i> which contains two tags <i>access</i> and <i>citischool-project</i>. Ungrouped tags appear towards the bottom of the list. Tag Groups which have no tags assigned to them will not appear in this list.</p>

<h4>Figure 1. The Tag dialog for a node called 'Michelle', showing the Tag Assignment panel</h4>
</center>

<br>
<p>Below this tag list there are two buttons. The first toggles between 'Expand All Folders' and 'Collapse All Folders', which in turn open or close all tag group folders.</p>

<p>The second button labelled 'Add', assigns the selected tag/s to the current node/s. Visually you will see the selected tag/s appear in the right-hand list.</p>

<p>When the tag dialog is first opened, this right-hand list displays all tags currently assigned to the selected node/s. As you assign additional tags, they will appear in this list. In this example,  the node 'Michelle' has one tag currently assigned to it called <i>actionitem</i>. You can remove tags from the list by first selecting them and then pressing the 'Remove' button, (this button becomes available when you select a tag to remove).</p>

<p>You can add and remove tags in this way until you are happy with your decisions.</p>
<p>In order to save your changes you must press either the 'Apply' or 'OK' buttons, which appear at the bottom of the dialog. The 'Apply' button will save your changes but leave the dialog window open. The 'OK' button will save your changes and then close the dialog window.</p>

<p>If you wish to discard your changes, press the 'Cancel' button, which will close the dialog window without saving.</p>
