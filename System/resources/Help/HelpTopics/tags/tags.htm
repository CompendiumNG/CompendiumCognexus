<p>Tags are additional information elements attached to a particular node. They allow you to notionally group nodes with similar ideas or concepts. </p>
<p>You can then use these tags to search for all nodes with certain tags. This is useful, for example, in investigating node and concept relationships between various views.</p>

<p>The tag view can be opened in several ways:
<li>From the View Menu</li>
<br>

</center>
<br>

<li>From the <a href="../toolbars/tags.htm">Tags Toolbar</a> by pressing the 'T' icon. If the tags view is alreay open, it will make usre it is in the top tab of the lef-hand tabbed area, and fully opened, if it has been closed with the divding bar. </li>

</center>
<br>
<li>Pressing Ctrl + T on the keyboard. </li>
<br>
<br>
<p>The 
Tags View is divided into two main sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Tags Tree Area: This holds the text area for creating tags and tag groups and the tag tree. </li>
<li>The Working Tags Area: This holds a list of nodes, either the nodes  which the selected tags has been assigned to, or the selected nodes in the current view. Either way it represents the nodes which subsequest action will effect. </li>
</ol>
<p>In figure 2 below you can see that the Working tags area is located below the tag tree. </p>

</center>
<p>You can however locate it beside the tag tree by pressing the button at the bottom of the tags panel called 'Horizontal Split' which will result in the layout in figure 3. </p>

</center>
<p>You will notice that the button has now changed it's text to 'Vertical Split'. You can switch between the two easily.</p>
  <p><strong>The Tags Tree Area </strong></p>
  <p>The tags tree initially holds a default set of tags in a flat list. You can then create new tags and tags group (which display as folders). For more information on working with tags and tag groups see <a href="../tags/tag_maintenance.htm">Tags</a> and <a href="../tags/tag_group_maintenance.htm">Tag Groups</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>The Tags Working Area </strong></p>
  <p>The tags working area holds a list of the current working set of nodes which you wish to assign/unassign tags to. It is a sortable table with columns for the node type icon, the tags, the views the node is in, the node label, and the last modification date. The tags and views columns are very small and like the map node icon indicators you can rollover them to display lists of tags and views for a given node. Also, like the map node views rollover list, this rollover list is  active and selecting a view from the list will open it. There is also a button at the bottom if the list with which you can insert the selected nodes into the current view. <br>
