<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When you export a map using the 'Export as Web Maps' option, a html page will be built which has an expandable menu down the left-hand side of the screen listing all the views and  nodes that you chose to export. For each map view, an
image map is produced, (which is displayed in the main part of the screen). </p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">As maps are jpegs of the
Compendium maps exported they appear exactly as they do in Compendium. You can
roll over nodes to view a detail preview, click on nodes to open their detail
windows in full, roll over Tag indicators to view Tags, roll over Transclusion
indicators to see a clickable list of a node's parent views.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">This export option now also
has export to full depth capabilities, as well as the new options to export with
references and to a zip file.</font></span><br>

<h2>Export Options</h2>

<h2 align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">When you select
to export to Web Maps you will see the following dialog:</font></span></h2>
