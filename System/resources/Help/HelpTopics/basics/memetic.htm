The memetic project supports the development of asynchronous collaboration on
the Access Grid. The Access Grid™ (AG) is an open collaboration and resource
management architecture ( for more information on the Access Grid see:
<a href="http://www.accessgrid.org">www.accessgrid.org</a> ). Compendium 
is one of many tools which can be used in conjunction with Access Grid meetings. <p>

<p>Compendium is setup and controlled in an Access Grid meeting through 
using&nbsp; the<b> </b>memetic<b> Meeting Manager</b>, which consists of a set 
of webpages', which can be accessed from the memetic website 
  ( <a href="http://www.memetic-vre.net/">www.memetic-vre.net</a> ). The Meeting Manager will control and co-ordinate the whole process of setting up a memetic-enabled meeting and 
  starting/stopping all the various softwares for you, including Compendium.<p>For more information on the memetic project, and access to the 
memetic Meeting Manager, please go to:
http://www.memetic-vre.net/&nbsp;&nbsp; (you will 
need to copy this link to your browser).</p>
</p>
<p>There are three main areas to discuss in relation to Compendium and memetic:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#record">Record An Access Grid Meeting</a></li>
  <li><a href="#replay">Replay An Access Grid Meeting</a></li>
  <li><a href="#upload">Upload Recorded Meeting Events</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p align="left"><a name="record"><b><font size="4">Record An Access Grid Meeting</font></b></a></p>
<p align="left">The setup, 
starting and stopping of a meeting recording will all be done for you from the Meeting 
Manager 'Record' screen. (See the help for Meeting Manager on the memetic website, for more details).</p>
<p align="left">While you are mapping the meeting in Compendium, certain event 
data is being capture for the nodes you are creating/deleting, the views you are 
opening, the tags you are adding/deleting and the external documents you are 
accessing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Note: </b>If you add additional agenda item nodes to a meeting map yourself 
during a meeting recording, 
can you please tag them as an 'Agenda Item' in order for them to be processed 
correctly later by the Meeting Replay tool. </p>
<p align="left">Once you have stopped recording you will see a couple of 
progress bars appear and disappear as Compendium uploads the relevant data from 
the recording. All the event data captured by 
Compendium will be stored into a file and uploaded for you. In addition, the 
relevant compendium views will be exported to XML along with any referenced 
materials and put in a zip file. This file will also be uploaded. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Note:</b> If the Meeting Manager fails to stop Compendium 
there is a 'Manual Stop' option on the 'memetic' submenu, which can be found on 
the <a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tools Menu</a>. But this should only be done in 
an emergency, if the communication between the Meeting Manager web page and 
Compendium completely fails.</p>
<p align="left">If anything goes 
wrong during the upload of either file, the files are stored locally and you can 
attempt a further upload in the future (for details on how to upload this data 
later see <a href="#upload">Upload Recorded Meeting Events</a>).&nbsp; </p>
<br>
<p align="left"><a name="replay"><b><font size="4">Replay An Access Grid Meeting</font></b></a></p>
<p align="left">The setup, 
starting and stopping of a meeting replay will all be done for you from the Meeting 
Manager 'Replay' screen. (See the help for Meeting Manager on the memetic website, for more details).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Currently you can change the Video Index for a 
Compendium node after it has been created, either through the Properties page of 
the node Contents dialog, or by using the node right-click menu and selecting 
'Assign the Video' which assigns the Video Index of that node to any other 
select nodes. This change is only local to Compendium and is not currently 
uploaded. </p>
<p>While the replay is running, Compendium can request that the Meeting Replay 
move to a specific point during the meeting. To do this you can either press the 
small red 'M' indicator by an node, or use the right-click menu option 'Replay 
Video'. In either case the video will jump to the point in the meeting that that 
node was created.</p>
<p>In addition, Meeting Replay can make requests of Compendium. Firstly it can 
ask Compendium to open a specific map and focus a specific node. Secondly, it 
can ask Compendium to create a new node in the current map, (see the Meeting 
Replay help for more details).</p>
<p>During the replay, Compendium will be recording node 
creation/deletion and tag creation/deletion events which you can choose to 
upload when you stop replaying.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Note:</b> If the Meeting Manager fails to stop Compendium 
there is a 'Manual Stop' option on the 'memetic' submenu, which can be found on 
the <a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tools Menu</a>. But this should only be done in 
an emergency, if the communication between the Meeting Manager web page and 
Compendium completely fails.</p>
<p align="left">When you stop the replay by pressing the 
stop button in the Meeting Manager replay page you will see a dialog asking you if you wish to 
upload the Compendium meeting replay event data, (see dialog below):</p>

<p align="center">
<font size="2">Figure 1. The Upload Choice dialog.</font></p>
<p align="left">If you select 'Upload',&nbsp; all the event data captured by 
Compendium will be stored into a file and uploaded for you. In addition, the 
relevant compendium views will be exported to XML along with any referenced 
materials and put in a zip file. This file will also be uploaded.  </p>
<p align="left">If anything goes 
wrong during the upload of either file, the files are stored locally and you can 
attempt a further upload in the future (for details on how to upload this data 
later see <a href="#upload">Upload Recorded Meeting Events</a>).&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">If you 
select 'Discard', Compendium will delete all the event data stored for that 
meeting and nothing will be uploaded.</p>
<br>
<p align="left"><a name="upload"><b><font size="4">Upload Recorded Meeting Events</font></b></a></p>
<p align="left">If you have experienced some sort of upload failure during a 
meeting Recording or Replay, the data has been stored locally on your machine 
and you can attempt a further upload by using the Meeting Upload dialog.
This dialog can be accessed from the 'Manual Upload' option on the 'memetic' 
submenu found on the&nbsp; <a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tools Menu</a>.</p>
<p align="left">The dialog below will open, listing all meeting event data
recordings that have not been uploaded yet. For each meeting event data
recording saved, the list will display the meeting name the events where saved
against, the type, the is whether the event data comes from a recording the original
meeting, ('Main Meeting&quot;), or a replay of the meeting, (&quot;Replay&quot;), and the date
the events where captured.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Figure 2. The Meeting Upload dialog.</font></p>
<p align="left">Select a meeting recording to upload, and press the 'Upload'
button. If there is an error during upload you will be shown a relevant error
message, otherwise the relevant data files will be marked as uploaded and it will not be
displayed in the meeting upload list again.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Note:</b> You must always upload the main meeting before 
attempting to upload any replay data for it.</p>
