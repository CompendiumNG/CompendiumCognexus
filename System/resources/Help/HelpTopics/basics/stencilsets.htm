Stencil sets define groups of stencil items.&nbsp; A stencil item defines certain properties
of a potential node. It is basically for creating new nodes with a given image
and possibly tags and a label. It is
restricted to reference and view nodes as these can have images.<p><b>NOTE:</b>
This facility is only for use with map views and will not work for list views.</p>
<p>Stencil set<a> data is saved in the form of an xml file for each stencil set.
Stencil sets are stored in the Compendium subfolder 'System\resources\Stencils' in further
subfolders named after the stencil sets. Inside these stencil set folders will
be the xml file holding the data and three further subfolders called 'nodeimages', 'paletteimages'
and Templates, holding the relevant stencil set item images and template files
(see below for further details). As all
relevant data is contained in a stencil set folder, stencil sets can easily can
be shared with other users if desired, by simply zipping up the relevant stencil
set folder folder and sending it to them.</a></p>
<p>

<h2>Stencil Management</h2>

<p>You can create stencil sets
and stencil items using the Stencil management dialog. This can be
accessed from the
<a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tools Menu<a> or the <a href="../menus/rightview.htm#map">Map Right-Click Menu</a>. The initial Stencil management dialog will look something link figure 1 below:</p>

<h4 align="center">Figure 1. The Stencils management dialog<br>

</h4>

<p>
To create a stencil set, press the 'Create New Stencil Set' button at the top
of the Stencils management dialog. This will open the Stencil Set dialog, (which
will initially be empty):</p>

<p align="center">
<IMG SRC="../images/stencils2.gif" width="339" height="433"></p>
<h4 align="center">Figure 2. The Stencil Set dialog</h4>

<p>
You then need to enter a name for the new stencil set in the 'Full Name' field at the top of
the dialog. When you later open stencil sets to use them they appear in a tabbed pane panel
on the left side of the compendium application screen (see figure 6 below in the
section called <a href="#usingstencils">Using Stencils</a>). Each stencil set opened
will have&nbsp;a tabbed panel. The field 'Tab Name' allows you to enter an
abbreviated name to appear as the tab panel label.</p>

<p>
You can then start adding new stencil set items. To add a new stencil set item
press the 'Add Item' button. This will open a 'Stencil Set Item' dialog similar
to figure 3
below, (which will initially be blank):</p>

There are various properties you can set for a stencil set item:</p><br>

            a new node from this stencil set item. You choices are 'Reference',
            'Map' and 'List', as only these three node types can have images.</td>

  		<td width="300" valign="top">

            stencil set.
            <p>When you have more than one stencil set open and use a keyboard
            shortcut, it will take this to be the top-most open stencil set

            <p>If you select a node icon image which is larger than the scaled
            size of 96 x 96 pixels, you will be warned, but it will not stop you

            <p>Note: when you save a stencil set, the image will be copied to

            will have all the relevant materials within.

            be used.</p>
  			<p>Having this as a separate item allows you to set smaller image

When you have completed all these fields, press 'Save' to save the new stencil
set item
and return to the Stencil Set dialog. You will see that the new Stencil Set item has
appeared as in figure 4:</p>

If you wish to edit any stencil set item select it and press the 'Edit' button, This
will open a Stencil Set Item dialog with the existing details for you to edit, as in
figure 3 above. If you wish to delete a stencil set item, simply select it from the
list and press the 'Delete' button. </p>

<p>
Once you have added all the items you desire press 'Save', button a new folder
containing an xml file holding the stencil set data will be created, the Stencil
Set dialog will close and the new stencil set will appear in the Stencils
management dialog:</p>

<p>

If you wish to edit any stencil set select it and press the 'Edit' button, This
will open a Stencil Set dialog with the existing details for you to edit. </p>

<p>

The 'Duplicate' button allows you to
duplicate the selected stencil set, if you wish to create a second stencil set very similar
to an existing one. You will be asked to give a name for the stencil set, and
then the contents of the selected stencil set will be copied under the new name.</p>

<p>

If you
wish to delete a stencil set, simply select it from the list and press the
'Delete' button </p>

<p>

<b>NOTE:</b> if Compendium cannot delete the associated folders and files due to the
system not allowing it, you will need to manually delete the associated stencil
set folder from the 'Stencils' directory in the Compendium home folder for the
stencil set to be permanently deleted, otherwise it will reappear next time you open
Compendium. </p>

There is another button on this dialog called 'Duplicate'. This allows you to
duplicate a stencil set, if you wish to create a second stencil set very similar
to an existing one. You will be asked to give a name for the stencil set, and
then the contents of the selected stencil set will be copied under the new name.<p>

<p>To use a stencil set, go to the
<a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tools Menu<a> or the <a href="../menus/rightview.htm#map">Map Right-Click Menu</a> and select 'Open Stencil'. This
option has a submenu listing all your current stencil sets. If you select one,
you will see a tabbed panel appear on the left-hand side of the screen showing
a palette of your chosen stencil set, (see figure 6 below)</p>

<h4 align="center">Figure 6. An open stencil set.</h4>

<p>You can open more than one stencil set at a time and you will get a stack of
palette tabs build up, as in figure 7 below:</p>

<p>To create a new node with from a stencil item, just drag the stencil set item
from its stencil palette and drop onto a map. A new node will be created with the
properties defined by the stencil set item dragged. Figure 8 shows a new node
created from a stencil set item:</p>

<h4 align="center">Figure 8.&nbsp; A new node created from dragging over a
stencil set item.</h4>

</a>

<p>If the stencil dragged was a map or list node type, and had an associated
Compendium template file, this file should have been loaded as the contents of
the new node.</p>

<p>You can edit a stencil set item directly by double-clicking on the item in
the stencil set palette. This will open a Stencil Set Item dialog with the details
of that item to edit. When you save the item you will see the dialog for the
Stencil set appear and when you save that, the Stencil management dialog, as
usual. It simply provides a shortcut to opening all the appropriate dialogs
directly. Figure 9 below shows a stencil set item being edited directly from the
stencil set panel:</p>
