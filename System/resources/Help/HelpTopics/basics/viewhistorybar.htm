This bar displays a path listing the views that where navigated through to reach
the currently open view.</p>
<p>

It is not the same thing as the Views History accessed from the <a href="../toolbars/main.htm">Main Toolbar</a>,
which shows all views opened or selected so far during a session.</p>
<p>

The view history bar shows one possible  path of Ancestor views the current view
has, the one navigated through during the current session.
</p>
<p>

You can click on any view label in the path to re-open / go to that view.</p>
<p>

If you first open a view from say the 'Find a Map/List' option on the <a href="../menus/map.htm">Views
Menu</a>, or any of the other dialogs which allow you to open a view directly, you
will get a text description of that starting point as the first element in the
path, and this will not be navigable.</p>
<p>

You can turn this bar on and off from the <a href="../menus/map.htm">Views
Menu</a>.<br>
