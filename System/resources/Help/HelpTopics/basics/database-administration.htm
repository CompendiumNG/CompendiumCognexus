<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Compendium now uses Derby for its default database.&nbsp; Initially
Compendium will open connected to this local default database. </p>

<p>However, Compendium can still be used with both local and remote copies of
MySQL. In order to use Compendium with MySQL you must first set up a profile for
each of the MySQL applications you wish to connect to, (see below for full
details).</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Creating <a name="creating">MySQL Profile</a>s</font></b></p>
<p>First go to the <a href="../menus/file.htm">File Menu</a> and select 'Database
Administration'. This
will then open the following dialog:</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center">

<h4 align="center">Figure 1: The Database Administration dialog</h4>
<p align="left">The first options on the dialog allows you to indicate that you
wish to see the full path of the database connection in the Compendium
application title bar. This is not checked by default, where instead of the full
path you see just the current project name and if connected to a MySQL profile,
the profile name in square brackets after.</p>
<p align="left">By default, you will be set to use the default Derby database.
If you check the 'Use a MySQL database' radio button the lower half of the
dialog will become available, and allow you to set up MySQL application
connection profiles.</p>
<p>You should then see the following:</p>

<h4 align="center">Figure 2: The Database Administration dialog with MySQL
database selected</h4>
<p align="left">You can now create a MySQL connection profile. Press the 'New'
button and a small dialog will popup asking you for the name of the new profile
as in figure 3 below:</p>


<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/DatabaseMaintenanceNew.gif" width="268" height="122"></p>
<h4 align="center">Figure 3: The New connection profile name dialog.</h4>


<p>Enter the name (this must be unique, i.e. not two profiles can have the same
name). Then press 'OK'. Your new profile name will appear in the drop-down box
beside the 'New' button and the default host name 'localhost' will be filled in
the 'MySQL Host Address' field and the default user name 'root' will be filled
in the 'MySQL User Name' field. </p>
<p>You can of course change these to match your MySQL installation whether local or remote, they are just defaults. </p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> You can include the port number as part of the Host Address field entry if your MySQL installation does not use the usual port by appending the host address with a colon followed by the port number, e.g. mysqlinstallation.com:3308</p>
<p>Once you have
  completed all the details press the 'Save' button. The 'Connect' button will
  then become available. Press the 'Connect' button.</p>
<p align="center">

<h4 align="center">Figure 4: The Database Administration dialog for a New MySQL
profile.</h4>


<p>If there are no Compendium projects in the MySQL application you have
connected to, the 'New Project' dialog will be opened for you. If you have
already connected before, created one or more projects and specified a default
project, you would automatically be logged in (provided it is a local
application). Otherwise, the 'Open Project' dialog will appear.</p>
<p>To delete a profile, select the profile from the drop-down box and press the
'Delete' button. Note: you cannot delete the profile you are currently connected
to.</p>
<p>You can set up as many MySQL profiles as required, and then use the 'Database
Administration' dialog to switch connections, or switch back to the local Derby
database application.</p>
