<p class="body">ECOSENSUS (Electronic/Ecological Collaborative Sensemaking
Support System) is an e-Social Science project, led by The Open University, UK
(Systems Department and Knowledge Media Institute). </p>
<p class="body">ECOSENSUS is investigating the sociotechnical issues around
developing collaboration tools for participatory environmental decision making
amongst (a) marginalised natural resource users in Guyana, (b) professional
'experts' from different countries, and (c) key decision makers associated with
managing ecosystems. A secondary activity is to produce open content learning
resources to train students to facilitate such forms of distributed
environmental decision making.</p>
<p class="body">This project aims to integrate a state of the art Geographical
Information System (uDig
<img border="0" src="../../../Images/udig16.gif" width="16" height="16">)&nbsp;with
Compendium, in order to assist the Makushi Amerindian tribespeople, who
live in the Rupununi region of Guyana, to better negotiate, understand and
discuss their natural resource conservation and livelihood improvement needs, by
providing distributed decision-making support.</p>
<p>

<p>
These facilities can of course be used by anyone who downloads the Ecosensus
software (go to <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/ecosensus/">http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/ecosensus/</a>
for more details).</p>

<p>
In order to access the uDig support built into this version of Compendium you
must first turn on communications with uDig. You do this by going to the Tools
Menu &gt; Options (Preferences) &gt; Misc tab.<br>
</p>

<font size="2">Figure 1. The Options dialog.</font></p>
<p align="left">Now Compendium can receive incoming requests from uDig and can
also send requests to uDig.</p>
<p align="left">There are currently two messages that can be sent to uDig by the
user and one that is sent by the system. The options that the user can access
are found on <a href="../menus/rightnode.htm">The Node Right-Click Menu</a>. </p>
<p align="left">
  			<b>Open uDig Map</b></p>
<p align="left">This option will only appear if the node clicked on was created from
            uDig and has the relevant uDig reference. (you can view this reference on the <a href="../nodes/node_details.htm#properties">Node Properties</a> panel.) If you select this option,
and uDig is not running, Compendium will first attempt to start the uDig
application. Once / if uDig is running, it will send a message to uDig to open
the corresponding map and layer and highlight the icon point that the Compendium
map was originally created from.</p>
<p align="left">
  			<b>Add Label to Parent map point</b></p>
<p align="left">This option will only appear if the node clicked is inside a map created from uDig
            which has the relevant uDig reference. If you select this option,
and uDig is not running, Compendium will first attempt to start the uDig
application. Once / if uDig is running, It will take the labels from all
selected nodes and send them as properties to the icon point in uDig that the
parent map node was originally created from. the node labels will only be sent
if they have the correct format of some text=some other text, e.g. 'length=10'
or 'colour=blue' etc.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Node Label Update</b></p>
<p align="left">If you edit the node label of a map node that was originally
created from uDig, Compendium will attempt to send uDig a label update message
to update the label of the originating icon point. If uDig is not running,
Compendium will first attempt to start the uDig application. </p>
<p align="left"><b>N.B. </b>There is also an option on the <a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tools Menu</a> to launch the
uDig application manaully.</p>
