/**
 * Class Union
 *
 *     This class is used for the BYacc parser. The current
 *     version only supports integer return values from the
 *     lexer. This union class will enable the parser to
 *     support other types as well. After generating the
 *     parser code from BYacc the definition of the
 *     semantic values have to be altered to be of type
 *     Union. The attributes are made public to allow for
 *     minimal changes in the generated code. The generated
 *     code makes direct references.
